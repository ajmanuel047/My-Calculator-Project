# My-Calculator-Project

Excited about this project as I have learnt quite a lot on CSS, html, using javascript to manipulate the DOM, and so much more.
The idea of this project is to solidify my understanding on everything I have so far learnt.

# Where I Had Challenges

    1. Getting the calculator to do a simple calculation between just two numbers and just one operator was easy but getting it to use more than one operator and more than two numbers was quite challenging
    2. Making the decimal number to work the way i wanted was not easy. It came with quite a lot of challenge
    3. At a point i felt my code was becoming too much and had to refactor it which reduced it from almost 2000 lines to close to 1000.

What I learnt
I actually came to understand during this project why applications come out with updates either to add features or to fix bugs as after completing the calculator project i tested out different operations and not all worked right which made me to fix them one after the other. As i fixed a bug i found another bug. It was fun and also quite exhausting.
